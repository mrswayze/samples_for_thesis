\chapter{Preliminaries: Digraphs}

\section{Basic Digraph Terminology}
The digraph terminology used in this thesis is mostly based on the book of \textsc{Bang-Jensen} and \textsc{Gutin}~\cite{bang2008digraphs}. A digraph $\gls*{D}=(V(D),A(D))$ consists of a finite set $\gls*{V(D)}$ of so called \textbf{vertices} and a finite set $\gls*{A(D)}$ of ordered pairs of distinct vertices of $D$, so called \textbf{arcs} of the digraph $D$. 

At this point, we would like to cite the following material, which---with certainty---is very enjoyable to read: \cite{Bang-Jensen2020Critical, borodin1977criterion, borodin1977criterion, dirac1950colouring, schweser2018low-connectivity, schweser2020crit, stiebitz2015brooks}
